# This workflow runs tests, formatting checks, and the fspec tool.
#
# To set up branch protection for master/main (require reviews and passing CI):
#   1. Go to your repository on GitHub
#   2. Navigate to Settings > Branches
#   3. Click "Add branch protection rule" or edit existing rule for master/main
#   4. Enable the following options:
#      - "Require a pull request before merging"
#        - Enable "Require approvals" (set to 1 or more)
#        - Optionally enable "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"
#      - "Require status checks to pass before merging"
#        - Select "Test Suite" as the required status check
#      - Optionally: "Require conversation resolution before merging"
#      - Optionally: "Do not allow bypassing the above settings" (prevents admins from bypassing)
#   5. Click "Create" or "Save changes"
#
# Note: Branch protection cannot be configured via files alone - it requires
# repository settings access. However, this workflow will fail if tests don't pass,
# which effectively enforces the requirement.
