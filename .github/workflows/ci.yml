# This workflow runs tests, formatting checks, and the fspec tool.
# To require passing CI for merges to master/main:
#   1. Go to Settings > Branches in your GitHub repository
#   2. Add a branch protection rule for master/main
#   3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
#   4. Select "Test Suite" as the required status check
#
# Note: Branch protection cannot be configured via files alone - it requires
# repository settings access. However, this workflow will fail if tests don't pass,
# which effectively enforces the requirement.
